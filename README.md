This repository is for an interactive webpage where users can place icons of musical instruments into the center of the dancefloor to trigger a loop of that instrument. These instruments include a synthesizer, a drum, a guitar and a bass. The theme is reminiscent of the popular disco/funk sound of the 80's with influences of 90's west coast hip hop.
